# Wanna Know What's Happening?

## Description

This repository contains a Dashborard that shows you the a variaty of information combined in one place for when things re-open in Canada. 

During this pandemic, we've all been through lockdowns or quarantines, and most of us are probably sitting at home wondering what is going on in the word outside. Thus, this application integrates multiple APIs to provide information on Covid-19 statistics as well as events, restaurants and recreations based on the location chosen by the user. This works at the moment only in Canada.
